# sales

Here the data contain information about pharma company
a pharama company was facing issues with counterfeits of its brands
so company wanted to put these counterfeit operations out of business
so in order to make maximum impact wanted to focus on operations for the time being
To do that it needed to predict sales of counterfeit medicines and counterfeit operations
The model was Regression Model bescause sales is a continuous numeric 
Exmining the data imputing missing values
Dealing with the outliers 
Used Linear Regression,Decisiontrees,randomforest,Gradientboosting and Xgboost(Regression Methods) In python with hyper parameter Tuning and K-Fold crossvalidation 
The quality of Regression Models is ,How well its predictions matchup against actual values and error metrics (RMSE.MAE,neg_MAE) arae used to judge the quality of the model----
-----which enables us to compare regressions against other regressions with valid paremeters
From the above mentioned models Gradient boosting method is the best model as it has the lower MAE value.which explaines the highest variability and tells us how well the model fits -
-in this data.
